                   Graduated from North Hennepin Community College with a Business Administration Associate degree and a Minor in English. My parents and I stuggle adapting to the US custom due to language barrier and my father barely earn enough for the family. So I 
                   grow up very poor and was located in a project homes on highway 55. I saw how much my father have suffer due to his lack of education and language barrier this
                   this pushes me to become a successful web developer. However, I know that becoming a web develop takes time and that there's always room to grow and learn.

                    While I was in college I part take in club events such as Asian Association which promot asian culture across campus. I part take on significant role and apply or volunteer for a leadership position. Taking on a leadership role not only may help prepare 
                    me for future jobs but also teach you good leadership skills such as how to work with and motivate others. Leadership opportunities may be available in student government, tutoring, and even by starting my own club.
